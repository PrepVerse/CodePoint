        ??? abstract "Explanation"
            In this sequence, a number is followed by an alphabet and vice versa. Let's focus on the number pattern:

            - Start with 2.
            - Add 7 to get the next number: 2 + 7 = 9.
            - Subtract 3 to get the next number: 9 - 3 = 6.
            - Add 7 again: 6 + 7 = 13.
            - Subtract 3: 13 - 3 = 10.

            So, the next element in the sequence is: **10**

            1. **2A11:** 
                - The number starts at 2.
                - The letter 'A' is there.
                - The two digits are 11.
                - To go from 2A11 to 2D13:
                    - Multiply the number by 1 (2 * 1 = 2).
                    - Move the letter forward in the alphabet by 3 places (A + 3 = D).
                    - Increase the two digits by 2 (11 + 2 = 13).

            2. **2D13:**
                - The number is now 2.
                - The letter 'D' is there.
                - The two digits are 13.
                - To go from 2D13 to 4G17:
                    - Multiply the number by 2 (2 * 2 = 4).
                    - Move the letter forward in the alphabet by 3 places (D + 3 = G).
                    - Increase the two digits by 4 (13 + 4 = 17).

            3. **4G17:**
                - The number is now 4.
                - The letter 'G' is there.
                - The two digits are 17.
                - To find the next element:
                    - Multiply the number by 3 (4 * 3 = 12).
                    - Move the letter forward in the alphabet by 3 places (G + 3 = J).
                    - Increase the two digits by 6 (17 + 6 = 23).

            So, the next element in the sequence is: **12J23**
